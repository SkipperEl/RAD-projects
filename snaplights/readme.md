# Snap on, Snap off: Myo Light Control

This is the RAD team's first project. Suggested by @tbaker6. When you snap, turn on some lights. Pretty simple, but very awesome.

I used two key components: Our hue.js library, and a snap dectector built on top of myo.js. I wrote the hue.js for a CES demo earlier this year. I was frustrated with the existing hue javascript libraries, so threw this one together. Feel free to use it :)

I wrote some experimental snap detection for Myo.js and made the two talk. Makes for a great little demo!

Thanks again for @tbaker6 for the suggestion!
